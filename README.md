This code imports the sqlite3 library and connects to a database named "database_library".

It then creates a table called "library" with four columns: "id", "title", "autor", and "qty". 

The code then inserts several records into the table using placeholders and the "execute" method.

The code defines four functions: "enter_book", "update_book", "delete_book", and "search_book".

These functions allow the user to enter new books, update existing books, delete existing books, and search for specific books in the table respectively.

The code also has a while loop that allows the user to continuously perform these actions until they choose to exit the program.
